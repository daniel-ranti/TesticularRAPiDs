# TesticularRAPiDs

This is the Github repository for the code used to create the graphs and figures for the work entitled *Rapid Assessment of Patient Drug Sensitivity (RAPiDS) screens to assess therapeutic regimens for the treatment of rare genitourinary tumors*. The work above was presented in part at the [AUA](https://www.auajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1097/JU.0000000000002612.10)

There are currently 3 scripts in the repository. Each script is commented and annotated for replicability.
